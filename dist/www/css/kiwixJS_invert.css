 *
 * Stylesheet for applying a content theme to articles extracted from a ZIM archive by Kiwix JS.
 * 
 * This is a pure generic stylesheet for inverting the display of content extracted from any ZIM.
 * The actual inversion is done in app.css by applying an inversion filter to the element in the outer document (e.g. iframe)
 * that contains the embedded article. This stylesheet re-inverts images and videos so that they do not look like
 * photographic negatives. In principle, inversion could be achieved by adding the 'html' selector to the first rule below,
 * but this causes non-WAI-compliant flashes (to white) between article loads in Service Worker mode.
