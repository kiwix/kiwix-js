                    <p>
                        If your Internet access is expensive, slow, unreliable, insecure or censored, you can still gain free offline access to vast
                        repositories of human knowledge and culture. Carry the world's largest Encyclopaedia around in your pocket, in any language,
                        or a worldwide Travel Guide when you are on the road! 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To <a href="#usage">use this app</a>, you will need to download one or more archives (called ZIM archives) from the Kiwix website and store them on your device
                        or a thumb drive. You will then be able to access Wikipedia, Wiktionary, WikiMed, Wikivoyage and many other sources offline, even
                        if you are undertaking a long plane journey, hiking, and travelling or living in areas with weak Internet access.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        You can search through article titles and read any of these articles (including the images) completely offline. Archives are available
                        with content in many different languages. There are "themed" archives with selected topics of interest from Wikipedia such as medicine,
                        movies, history, geography, maths, physics, chemistry or computing (amongst many others).
                    </p>

                    <h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>

                    <h4>Step 1: Download some content</h4>
                    <p>
                        Go to <a href="https://download.kiwix.org/zim/" target="_blank">https://download.kiwix.org/zim&nbsp;<img src="img/Icon_External_Link.png" /></a>,
                        with a regular computer and download an archive that interests you. If you find the list overwhelming, you can limit the selection by language
                        on the <a href="https://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Content_in_all_languages" target="_blank">Download-by-language site&nbsp;<img src="img/Icon_External_Link.png" /></a>.
                        Note that archives with "mini" in their name only contain the lede (first) portion of each article; "nopic" means no pictures; "maxi" means
                        everything except video and audio. Larger versions without any of these qualifiers contain everything, though pictures are always compressed. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Currently only Mediawiki-based content (for instance <a href="https://download.kiwix.org/zim/wikipedia/" 
                        target="_blank">Wikipedia&nbsp;<img src="img/Icon_External_Link.png" /></a> and <a href="https://download.kiwix.org/zim/wikivoyage/" target="_blank">
                        Wikivoyage&nbsp;<img src="img/Icon_External_Link.png" /></a>), and <a href="https://download.kiwix.org/zim/stack_exchange/" target="_blank"> StackExchange&nbsp;<img
                        src="img/Icon_External_Link.png" /></a>, have been thoroughly tested</strong>. Dynamic content (e.g. PhET) is only supported in ServiceWorker Mode
                        (see <a href="#modes">technical explanation</a> below).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For a quick test, you can start with the <a href="https://download.kiwix.org/zim/wikipedia_en_ray_charles_maxi.zim" target="_blank">
                        Ray Charles ZIM file&nbsp;<img src="img/Icon_External_Link.png" /></a>, which contains some Wikipedia articles about the Jazz musician, or a
                        small archive containing the <a href="https://download.kiwix.org/zim/wikipedia_en_100_maxi.zim" target="_blank">top 100 English Wikipedia
                        articles and images&nbsp;<img src="img/Icon_External_Link.png" /></a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After that, download any content in your favourite language(s). Check the size before you download archives as many file sizes are very
                        large (several Gigabytes). Themed versions such as WikiMed, or versions without images are smaller than full Wikipedia archives and can
                        be readily downloaded in your browser. <b>Kiwix ZIM archives are completely open source and free to download.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p> 
                        See <a href="#FAT">Downloading large archives</a> below for details of how to download very large files.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Step 2: Copy the content onto your device</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you have enough space, you can put several archives on your device! If you don't have enough internal storage, consider using a modern
                        microSD card or thumb drive. For larger archives (greater than 2GB) on older devices, it is possible that an archive might not be supported
                        if your storage is formatted using a FAT filesystem (NB exFAT is fine). See <a href="#FAT">technical information</a> below for a solution.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Step 3: Drag and drop the file into the app</h4>
                    <p>
                        You can drag and drop the archive file into the the open app (if you have a split file, be sure to drag all parts), or else you can go to the
                        "Configure" menu and select your ZIM file.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Step 4: Enjoy your offline content!</h4>
                    <p style="text-align: right"><a href="#contents">↑ Back to Contents</a></p>

                    <h3 id="privacy">Privacy policy</h3>

                    <h4>Short version:</h4>
                    <p>
                        Kiwix JS works offline, and does not collect or record any of your personal data. It only remembers
                        your browsing history for the duration of a session (for the purpose of returning to previously
                        viewed pages). This history is lost on exiting the app and is not recorded in any way.
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Longer version:</h4>
                    <p>
                        This application only reads the archive files that you explicitly select on your device together
                        with files in its own package. Some ZIM archives contain active content (scripts) which may, in
                        rare circumstances, attempt to contact external servers for incidental files such as fonts.
                        These scripts will only run if you enable <a href="#modes">ServiceWorker Mode</a> in Configuration.
                        Nevertheless, if you believe your Internet access is insecure, or is being observed or censored, we
                        recommend that you completely shut down your Internet (Data or WiFi) access before using the application.</p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, if you obtained this app from a vendor Store (including extensions), then the Store
                        operator may track your usage of the app (e.g. download, install, uninstall, date and number of
                        sessions) for the purpose of providing anonymous, aggregate usage statistics to developers. If
                        this concerns you, you should check the relevant Store Privacy Policy for further information.
                    </p>

                    <h4 id="format">ZIM archive format</h4>
                    <p>
                        Offline archives use the <a href="https://www.openzim.org//wiki/OpenZIM" target="_blank">OpenZIM format&nbsp;<img src="img/Icon_External_Link.png" /></a>,
                        but note that this app has only been tested extensively on Wikipedia, WikiMedia and Stackexchage archives. Video content is in principle supported
                        if your device, browser or OS understands the format. Some other ZIMs use a proprietary dynamic UI which is only supported in ServiceWorker Mode
                        (<a href="#modes">see below</a>).
                    </p>

                    <h4 id="FAT">Downloading and storing large archives</h4>
                    <p>
                        Full version of Wikipedia can be enormous: French, German and Spanish Wikipedia with images are each >25GB; full English Wikipedia with images
                        is >90GB. For these very large archives you can find convenient <a href="https://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Content_in_all_languages" target="_blank">
                        Torrent links&nbsp;<img src="img/Icon_External_Link.png" /></a> which may be more reliable than attempting to use your browser. You can use an
                        open-source BitTorrent client such as <a href="https://www.qbittorrent.org/" target="_blank">QBittorrent&nbsp;<img src="img/Icon_External_Link.png" /></a>
                        with these links (install the software before clicking on the torrent link).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        If you need to store a large ZIM archive on an older filesystem formatted as FAT16 or FAT32, you need to be aware of the file size limits of those systems
                        (FAT16 < 2GiB; FAT32 < 4GiB). Most modern microSD cards, thumb drives or hard drives are formatted as exFAT or another modern FS such as NTFS, which do not
                        have this issue. If your ZIM archive is larger than the FS limit, it is possible to split the archive into several 2GiB-1 or 4GiB-1 files (or smaller).
                        You will need to give a file extension to each chunk in the right order following this pattern: <code>*.zimaa</code>, <code>*.zimab</code>, <code>*.zimac</code>,
                        <code>...</code>, etc.). When you pick this archive in the app, be sure to pick <b>all</b> the chunks, or drag-and-drop them all into the app.
                    </p>

                    <h4 id="modes">JQuery and ServiceWorker Modes</h4>
                    <p>
                        Depending on your browser or framework, this app may be capable of running in two different modes, which we call
                        "JQuery Mode" and "ServiceWorker Mode" for short. There is a toggle under Expert Settings in Configuration.
                        Here is a technical explanation of what these modes do:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <b>JQuery Mode</b>: This mode (which does not in fact require JQuery) is fine for everyday use with 
                                Wikipedia / WikiMedia archives, and is stable and safe. It is a way of inserting articles extracted from the
                                ZIM into the DOM (browser document) by injecting the content into an iframe or tab. We then use
                                native DOM methods, or sometimes JQuery, to parse the article's HTML and insert required assets 
                                (images, stylesheets, event listeners for hyperlinks, etc.). On old devices DOM traversal can be slow, 
                                but it is compensated for because we do not extract or run JavaScript assets (which would be technically
                                extremely complicated). As a result, for WikiMedia archives this mode is usually quite fast. On the downside,
                                ZIMs that have a proprietary dynamic UI (such as Gutenberg or TED talks) are only partially supported in this
                                mode: the UI does not work, but articles can be searched for and loaded from the search bar.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <b>ServiceWorker Mode</b>: This mode, as its name implies, requires that the browser or framework be capable of
                                installing a Service Worker. It works by intercepting the browser or framework's Fetch calls (network requests)
                                and supplying the requested content from the ZIM. This mode requires no DOM traversal, and the content is
                                read and supplied as-is from the archive. Dynamic content (e.g. JavaScript) and proprietary UIs are fully
                                supported in this mode. It can feel initially a little slower while commonly used assets are being cached,
                                but it soon equals JQuery mode in speed, at least in modern browsers. However, older browsers such as IE11 do
                                not support this mode, and the app must be running in a secure context (<code>https:</code>, <code>localhost</code>,
                                or certain browser extensions). Unfortunately, this mode is not currently supported in Mozilla (Firefox) browser
                                extensions. It <i>is</i> supported in Chromium browser extensions (e.g. Chrome or new Edge). Note that this mode
                                cannot run with the <code>file:</code> protocol (but only IE11 and old Edge allow the app to run by launching
                                <code>index.html</code> from the file system).
                            </li>
