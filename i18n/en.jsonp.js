If your ZIM archive is larger than the FS limit, it is possible to split the archive into several 2GiB-1 or 4GiB-1 files (or smaller). You will need to give a file extension to each chunk in the right order following this pattern: <code>*.zimaa</code>, <code>*.zimab</code>, <code>*.zimac</code>, <code>...</code>, etc.).

There is a toggle under Compatibility Settings in Configuration that allows you to select between these. Here is a technical explanation of what these modes do:",
      "about-contentinjection-para2": "<b>ServiceWorker Mode</b>: This is the default mode. As its name implies, it requires that the browser or framework be capable of installing a Service Worker, which is usually the case in modern browsers. It works by intercepting the browser or framework's Fetch calls (network requests) and supplying the requested content from the ZIM. In this mode, the content is read and supplied as-is from the archive to the browser. Dynamic content (e.g. JavaScript) and proprietary UIs are fully supported in this mode. This mode can feel initially a little slower than Restricted mode until commonly used assets are cached, but it soon equals Restricted mode in speed, at least in modern browsers. However, older browsers such as IE11 are incompatible with this mode, and the app must be running in a secure context (<code>https:</code>, <code>localhost</code>, or certain browser extensions). While this mode is not natively supported in Mozilla (Firefox) browser extensions, we provide a functional workaround by re-launching the extension as a Progressive Web App (PWA). Note that this mode cannot run with the <code>file:</code> protocol (but only IE11 and old Edge allow the app to run by launching <code>index.html</code> from the file system).",
      "about-contentinjection-para3": "<b>ServiceWorkerLocal Mode</b>: This is only available in Chromium extensions. It is the same as above, but due to very tight security restrictions in these extensions, no inline JavaScript or eval statements can run. Unfortunately, modern ZIMs may have such dynamic content, and so functionality may be restricted in this mode. Nevertheless, it is more secure: the content is sandboxed and no one-time server access is required to enable the Service Worker. You are protected from inline code execution at the cost of loss of some features in dynamic ZIMs.",
      "about-contentinjection-para4": "<b>Restricted Mode</b>: This mode prevents attached scripts from running in the iframe, so it is useful for checking the static content of a ZIM before you allow scripts to run. It is also compatible with older browsers or frameworks that cannot run Service Workers. The mode has limitations which mean that only static content can be displayed, such as that found in Wikipedia / WikiMedia archives and (for now) Stackexchange. It is a way of inserting articles extracted from the ZIM into the DOM (browser document) by injecting the content into an iframe or tab. We then use native DOM methods, or sometimes JQuery, to parse the article's HTML and insert required assets (images, stylesheets, event listeners for hyperlinks, etc.). On old devices, DOM traversal can be slow, but it is compensated for because we do not extract or run JavaScript assets (which would be technically extremely complicated). As a result, for WikiMedia archives this mode is usually quite fast. On the downside, ZIMs that have a proprietary dynamic UI (such as Gutenberg or TED talks) are only partially supported in this mode: the UI does not work, but articles can be searched for and loaded from the search bar.",
